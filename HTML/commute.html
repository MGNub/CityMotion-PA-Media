                <div>
                    <p>Commuting, whether it's to work, school, or a friend's house, has been made a lot more difficult in the United States. The carcentric road and city designs have made getting to places more time-consuming and dangerous.</p>
                    <p>The way cities are structured makes it dangerous and inefficient to commute without a car, deterring people from other means of transportation, such as biking or riding the bus.</p>
                    <p>Not only does it affect pedestrians and bikers, drivers are impacted negatively as well. While you'd think a carcentric design would make driving easier and more convenient, it has an opposite effect in some places.</p>

So I went at 4, the 4:10 bus got canceled, the 4:20 bus got canceled, but the 4:30 bus came on time, so technically it was right on time.”</p>

                        <h2>Walking</h2>
                        <p>Traveling by foot is definitely one of the most reliable and healthiest way to commute shorter distances. It allows for an individual to exercise while moving towards their destination at the same time.</p>
                        <h2>Biking</h2>
                        <p>Along with walking, using a bicycle is also an excellent method of commuting. There are many cities that allow bikes to be rented for a small price or for free, which makes it more accessible, and it is also significantly faster than going on foot, making it a good option for medium and longer distances.</p>

                <h2>US Public Transit</h2>
                <p>Another byproduct of the car-centric cities of America is the poor state of public transportation services, which contribute to America's heavy dependency on cars. Public transit in the US is unreliable because it's often not punctual and slow.</p>

                <p>Buses share the same road as cars, making it slow due to traffic, and doesn't provide any more benefits as to driving a car in terms of time and efficiency. The subways and trains in Philly are ill-maintained and filthy, and are also lacking in security.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>All of these factors, from pedestrian and bike hostile roads, to slow public transportation services, deter people from commuting using these methods of transportation, leading more people to rely on cars, which in turn also increases traffic.</p>
