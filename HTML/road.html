                <p class = 'hidden'>Overall, a stroad is a hybrid of a street and a road. They are expensive to build and maintain, they slow down traffic for drivers, and are hostile towards pedestrians. The problem is that they're harmful to the city, they're harmful to the people, and they're everywhere.</p>

                        <h2>Highways</h2>
                        <p>Not only are stroads dangerous for pedestrians, but they are also inconvenient for drivers as well, because of the slow traffic. The same thing can also be said about highways in America. While not all highways face the same issues, there are some highways with much higher traffic congestion than others, such as I-10 in Texas or I-290 in Illinois.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class = 'text'>
                        <h2>Solution?</h2>
                        <p>More lanes are usually added to highways in order to reduce traffic congestion. However, this is only a temporary fix. Once there's less traffic congestion, it'll encourage more people to use the highway, which will end up increasing traffic congestion to the same state as before. This is called induced traffic. It becomes a cycle of building more lanes, inducing more traffic, before building more lanes again. This is basically what happened to the I-10 in Houston, Texas, which boats a maximum of 26 lanes.</p>

                <p class = 'hidden'>Not only is expanding these highways expensive, they are only a short-term solution to traffic congestion, and they also come at the cost of using up land. Oftentimes, many parks, houses, and even whole neighborhoods are bulldozed to make room for these highway expansions.</p>
                <p class = 'hidden'>The real solution is to reduce the number of cars on the road, by making other methods of transportation more reliable. This will also allow better and more efficient use of land, which will improve the quality life within the city</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>There are a bunch of smaller things that can be done to improve the safety of roads and make them more accessible to everyone. For example, adding speed humps in needed areas, building more roundabouts, narrowing lanes, and dedicating spaces for pedestrians.</p>

                <p>Improving public transportation or biking infrastructure will also improve experiences for both drivers and non-drivers. The next page will be diving deeper into the correlation between good public transit and the traffic on roads.</p>

                <p>- This is a roundabout. There are around 9,000 of them in the USA, and according to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, they are proven to be safer than intersections with stop lights.</p>
